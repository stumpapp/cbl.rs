# CBL to JSON

A tool to convert legacy CBL files to the (upcoming) new format

## Current state

![No don't look, it's not ready](./.github/not-ready.png)

It's not ready

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out what version of CBL I have been using as a base
- [ ] Figure out the schemas (rough) for each version the tool needs to support
- [ ] Write the structure for the new format
- [ ] I'm sure a lot of other things
- [ ] Restructure the code to be a library-first, so Stump can use it once the new format is ready
- [ ] Remove this README todo list
